# Linear Regression

## Introduction:

Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, our goal is to predict health insurance charges based on certain factors.
For this example, let's assume we have a dataset that includes information on health insurance charges and associated characteristics of policyholders, such as age, body mass index (BMI), etc.
